# AI Summarizer

- An AI Summarizer is a tool or program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically generate a condensed version of a larger text or document. It is designed to read through a large amount of information and extract the most important points, key ideas, and essential details, condensing them into a shorter summary. AI Summarizers can be used for a variety of purposes, such as quickly understanding the main points of a lengthy article or report, generating summaries of news articles, or extracting important information from legal documents.
